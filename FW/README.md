# Firmware

## Overview

The firmware section of the NINA_PROJECT is responsible for implementing low-level drivers and structuring the firmware application. It is organized into the following subdirectories:

- **[App:](app/)** Contains the application logic and user interfaces.
- **[Common:](common/)** Includes shared utilities and common functionalities used across the application.
- **[Drivers:](drivers/)** Implements low-level drivers tailored for the specific hardware components.
- **[Linkers:](linkers/)** Contains linker scripts that define memory mapping and attributes.
- **[Tools:](tools/)** Provides utility scripts or tools to assist in development.

This structure helps maintain a clean organization and facilitates development and enhancements in firmware.
